# DevOps using Docker, Swarm and Kubernetes

This repo serves as a reference for all the work I did as part of the Docker Mastery udemy course. Concepts such as writing Compose files, deploying multi-node Swarm clusters and deployment to Kubernetes are also covered.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration/Continous Delivery is simply automation, and this is what binds DevOps together. The concept of CI/CD is the automated process of building, testing and deploying software. For this course I made use of GitHub Actions to practise this in the following apps.

| Application  | Summary |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [Httpenv server](https://github.com/Wvrmhat/httpenv.git)| Simple http server showing env variables| 
| [Voting app](https://github.com/Wvrmhat/example-voting-app.git)| Distributed app running across multiple containers
