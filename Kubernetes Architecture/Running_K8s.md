# Kubernetes locally 

Kubernetes can be installed through Docker Desktop, MiniKube, or MicroK8s. For this course I will be using Docker Desktop and some of the browser versions

> [!Note]
> [killer coda](https://killercoda.com/)  and [play with k8s](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/) are both browser versions to test kubernetes
